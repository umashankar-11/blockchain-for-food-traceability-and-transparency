# Blockchain for Food Traceability and Transparency

## Introduction

The Blockchain for Food Traceability and Transparency project is a system designed to track and ensure the authenticity, safety, and quality of food items from the source to the consumer. This project leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable ledger that records each step in the food supply chain, from farming to processing, shipping, and retail. By using blockchain, this project ensures that the food supply chain is transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof.

## Features

- **Food Item Registration**: Register food items in the system with details such as origin, type, certifications, and nutritional information.
- **Quality Check and Processing**: Track food processing stages and perform quality checks using simulated machine learning models.
- **Robot-Assisted Operations**: Automate actions such as quality checks, packaging, and processing using robots that interact with the food items and record their actions in the blockchain.
- **Food Item Shipping and Receipt**: Trace the movement of food items as they are shipped from processing plants to warehouses, and eventually received by stores.
- **Blockchain Traceability**: Use blockchain to store and trace food items, ensuring the integrity and transparency of the food supply chain.
- **Alerting System**: Receive alerts if blockchain integrity is compromised or when important events occur in the supply chain.
- **Food Item Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports about the traceability and status of food items in the system.

## Tech-Stack Used

- **Python**: Programming language used to develop the system and manage the blockchain.

## How to Run the Project
